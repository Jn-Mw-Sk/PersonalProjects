# In this exercise I am choosing a version of the example program foods.py
# used in the chapter and using two for loops to print each of the listed foods

my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli']
friend_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'ice cream']

print("My foods:")
for food in my_foods:
    print(food)

print("\nMy friend's foods:")
for food in friend_foods:
    print(food)

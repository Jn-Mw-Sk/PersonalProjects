# In this exercise I am writing a series of conditional tests.
# I am going to write at least 10 tests, 5 resulting in true and
# 5 resulting in false. The format for each should look something like this:
#   variable = value
#   print("\n Does variable = value? I guess True(False)")
#   print(variable == value(or other))

game = 'Monopoly'
print("\nDoes game equal Monopoly? I guess True!")
print(game == "Monopoly")

print("\nDoes game equal Catan? I guess False!")
print(game == "Catan")

game = 'Scrabble'
print('\nDoes game equal Scrabble? I guess False!')
print(game == 'Scrabble')

print("\nDoes game equal Raccoon Tycoon? I guess True!")
print(game == "Raccoon Tycoon")

game = 'Apples to Apples'
print("\nDoes game equal Apples to Apples? I guess True!")
print(game == 'Apples to Apples')

game = "Disney Villainous"
print("\nDoes game equal Checkers? I guess False!")
print (game == "Checkers")

print("\nDoes game equal Disney Villainous? I guess False!")
print(game == "Disney Villainous")

print("\nDoes game equal Disney Villainous? I guess False!")
print(game == "Disney Villainous")

game = "Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards: Duel at Mt. Skullfyre"
print("\nDoes game equal Go Fish? I guess False!")
print(game == "Go Fish")

print("\nDoes game equal Solitaire? I guess True!")
print(game == "Solitaire")

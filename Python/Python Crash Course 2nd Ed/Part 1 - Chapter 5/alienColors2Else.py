# For this program I am imagining an alien in a game is shot down and assigning a variable
#   called called alien_color and assigning it "red", "green", or "yellow".
#
#   I am going to use an if-else chain to determine how many points the player earned, that is:
#       1. If the color is green, output that the player earned 5 points.
#       2. If the color is not green, output that the player earned 10 points

# This version of the program uses an if block

alien_color = "red"

if alien_color == "green":
    print("You earned 5 points!")
else:
    print("You earned 10 points!")

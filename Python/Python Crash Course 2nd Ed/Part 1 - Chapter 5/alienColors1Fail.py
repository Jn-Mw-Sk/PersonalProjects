# For this program I am imagining an alien in a game is shot down and assigning a variable
#   called called alien_color and assigning it "red", "green", or "yellow".
#
#   I am also writing an if statement to test whether an alien's olor is green. If it is,
#   output a message that says the player won 5 points.

# This version of the program fails the test

alien_color = "red"

if alien_color == "green":
    print("You got 5 points!");
